# Internship Test Project

This is project is an interview test for an internship application at Inter Intel.

## Description

This project is a to test understanding of Polymer 3.0, UI and UX skills, and knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The project includes solutions to problems that generally include:

- Creating forms and displaying the data retrieved.
- Data fetching and displaying it.
- UI and UX with JS animations or transitions which I use the Canvas API and plain JavaScript to create a mini game.

## Overview

With no prior knowledge of Polymer 3.0 and coming from React I have got to learn that :

- Polymer 3.0 is used to make Web Components that are both backward compatible and future proofed meaning problems like versions are a non-issue.
- Polymer 3.0 has a unique and easier way of solving data binding as compared to React.
- Web Components make HTML files neater by combining many HTML tags into one component.
- Web Components are good with encapsulation which makes properties like styles not to leak to other components.
- Web Components can be used by other front-end frameworks.
- Polymer 3.0 is generally faster to run and render components as compared to React.
